A fatigue detection technology based on facial recognition, implemented as an online learning student status monitoring platform. The platform aims to address numerous challenges and issues faced by online education, particularly the lack of face-to-face supervision, leading to problems such as students easily experiencing lack of concentration and fatigue in virtual classrooms.

Core technologies: HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JS (JavaScript), Python, MongoDB, Redis.
